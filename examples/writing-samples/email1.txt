Dear Mr. Johnson,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to follow up on our recent discussion regarding the quarterly project timeline.

As we discussed during our meeting last week, the implementation phase is scheduled to begin on March 15th, with a target completion date of June 30th. I wanted to confirm that all necessary resources have been allocated and that the team is prepared to proceed as planned.

Please let me know if you have any questions or if there are any concerns that need to be addressed before we move forward. I'm available for a call at your convenience to discuss any additional details.

Thank you for your time and attention to this matter.

Best regards,
Sarah Williams
Project Manager
