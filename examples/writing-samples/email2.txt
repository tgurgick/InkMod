Hi there,

Thanks for reaching out about the new feature request. I've reviewed the specifications you sent over, and I think we can definitely make this work.

The development team has already started looking into the technical requirements, and we should be able to have a prototype ready by the end of next week. I'll keep you updated on our progress and let you know if we run into any issues.

Just to make sure we're on the same page, could you confirm the priority level for this feature? That will help us allocate the right resources.

Looking forward to hearing from you!

Cheers,
Mike
