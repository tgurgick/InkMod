print(f"Model 2 vocab: {len(model2['vocabulary'])}")
```

### **Export Model Info:**
```python
import pickle
import json

with open('enhanced_style_model.pkl', 'rb') as f:
    model_data = pickle.load(f)

    if hasattr(obj, 'most_common'):  # Counter object
        return dict(obj)
    return obj

json_data = {k: convert_for_json(v) for k, v in model_data.items()}
with open('model_info.json', 'w') as f:
    json.dump(json_data, f, indent=2)
```

## üéØ Key Takeaways

1. **Your model is persistent** - it remembers everything from previous training
2. **It's continuously learning** - each session builds on previous knowledge
3. **Performance is tracked** - you can see improvement over time
4. **Convergence is automatic** - the system knows when to stop training
5. **The file is human-readable** - you can explore and understand what was learned

The enhanced pickle file is your **personal writing style AI** - it contains everything needed to generate text that matches your unique writing style! üß†‚ú®
