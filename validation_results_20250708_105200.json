      "output": "Subject: Project Update and Next Steps\n\nHi team,\n\nI hope you're all doing well. I'm writing to provide an update on the project status and outline our next steps.\n\nAs of today, we've completed 75% of the initial phase, which puts us slightly ahead of schedule. The team has done an excellent job, and I appreciate everyone's hard work. Our goal is to finalize this phase by November 15th, and I believe we're on track to achieve that.\n\nLooking ahead, the next phase will involve integrating the feedback from our recent client review. I've attached the feedback document for your reference. Let's aim to address these points by the end of this month.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification on the feedback. I'm available for a meeting anytime this week if you feel a discussion would be helpful.\n\nThanks again for your dedication and commitment to excellence.\n\nBest,\nEmily",
